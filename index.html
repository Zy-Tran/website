<h1>Miku</h1>
<h2>By Hatsune Miku and Anamanaguchi</h2>
<p>[Intro]
    (Oo-ee-oo)

    (Oo-ee-oo)
    (Oo-ee-oo)
    
    [Verse 1]
    Miku, Miku, you can call me Miku
    Blue hair, blue tie, hiding in your Wi-Fi
    Open secrets, anyone can find me
    Hear your music running through my mind
    
    [Chorus]
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    
    [Refrain]
    I'm on top of the world because of you
    All I wanted to do is follow you
    I'll keep singing along to all of you
    I'll keep singing along
    
    [Chorus]
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-hoo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo

    Miku, Miku, what's it like to be you?
    20/20, looking in the rear view
    Play me, break me, make me feel like Superman
    You can do anything you want
    
    [Instrumental Break]
    
    [Refrain]
    I'm on top of the world because of you
    All I wanted to do is follow you
    I'll keep singing along to all of you
    I'll keep singing along
    I'm on top of the world because of you
    I do nothing that they could never do
    I'll keep playing along with all of you
    I'll keep playing along
    
    [Chorus]
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oo-ee-oo
    
    [Instrumental Break]
    [Outro]
    Where were we walking together?
    I will see you in the end
    I'll take you where you've never been
    And bring you back again
    Listen to me with your eyes
    I'm watching you from in the sky
    If you forget I'll fade away
    I'm asking you to let me stay
    So bathe me in your magic light
    And keep it on in darkest night
    I need you here to keep me strong
    To live my life and sing along
    I'm waiting with you wide awake
    Like your expensive poison snake
    You found me here inside a dream
    Walk through the fire straight to me</p>
